I'm a licensed dental hygienist and I'm calling to strongly oppose HB 970 and HB 1036.

This bill introduces a substandard care model that the dental hygiene community, both in Virginia and nationwide, strongly oppose.

Lowering standards of care is a serious health concern and puts patient safety at risk.

Expanding access should never come at the expense of quality, oversight, or evidence-based care.

I also want to share that I voted for the Governor and trust her commitment to protecting the public health.

I'm hopeful that she can place the same trust in licensed dental hygienists as trained healthcare professionals.

Please relay my strong opposition to HB 970 and HB 1036.
