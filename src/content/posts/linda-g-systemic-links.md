Periodontal disease, also known as gum disease, is linked to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease, Alzheimer's disease, and certain cancers.

Bacteria from under the gum can enter the bloodstream, triggering widespread inflammation that affects overall health.

Senate Bill 178 would make it so our Virginia population is more at risk for all of these terrible chronic diseases that are preventable by having a licensed registered dental hygienist.

Nearly half of the United States population over 30 years old has gum disease, and that increases to 70% over the age of 65 years old.

To become a licensed dental hygienist in the state of Virginia, I have to obtain my Bachelor's of Science degree in dental hygiene, pass a clinical board exam, and pass two written board exams. Not only that, but I stay up to date on current practices by obtaining 15 continuing education credits every year upon renewal of my license.

To allow a dental assistant, which does not need any license or degree, to do my job puts patients at risk.

My dental hygiene class from VCU only had 16 students. If admissions allowed more hygiene students in each class, we would have a significant increase of eager and talented registered dental hygienists in the state of Virginia.

I respectfully urge you to oppose Senate Bill 178 to uphold policies that prioritize patient safety, professional accountability, and the highest standards of care for Virginians.
