I strongly oppose this legislation as dental hygienists must graduate from a CODA accredited program, must pass a regional clinical board, and must pass national exams.

This extensive education that is then evaluated by regional and national teams not associated with the school system.

In Virginia, there is no requirement for a dental assistant, one, to have any formal training. This means one day they could be working as a waitress and the next day sitting beside a dentist handing the dentist instruments or trying to sterilize a room for the next patient.

Dentists, by nature of their training, are focused on diagnosis and restorative treatment. Their training is minimally focused on prevention. Dental hygienists are the prevention specialists on a dental team.

The training proposed for dental assistants is minimal and not sufficient to provide appropriate care for a patient. Moreover, there is no oversight and evaluation of the training by an impartial objective evaluator.

When you go to see the dentist and see your hygienist for an adult prophylaxis or a cleaning, the hygienist must go below the gum line in order to appropriately remove calculus or tartar.

No one likes to floss, so in order to go in between your teeth, the hygienist must go under the gum line to clean between your teeth.

The proposal of a dental assistant providing a supra or above the gum line procedure renders inadequate care for patients. This inadequate care leads to periodontal disease or gum disease.

The patient is unaware they are receiving substandard care.

Just remember, you would not want a certified nursing assistant to provide care delegated to a registered nurse.

You definitely do not want a dental assistant to provide duties delegated to a registered dental hygienist.

Please oppose Senate Bill 178 and Senate Bill 282.
