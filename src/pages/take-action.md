description: A simple way to contact Virginia legislators about SB 178 and HB 970.

# Take action

## 1) Call or email your legislator
Be brief, polite, and specific. Focus on **patient safety** and **transparency**.

### Phone script (30–45 seconds)
> Hello, my name is ____. I’m a constituent from ____. I’m calling to ask the Delegate/Senator to oppose **SB 178 / HB 970** as written. These bills expand scaling and polishing to a new assistant certification and risk incomplete care and patient confusion. Please protect standards of care in preventive dentistry. Thank you.

### Email template
Subject: Please oppose SB 178 / HB 970 (patient safety and transparency)

Body:
> Dear [Delegate/Senator] [Name],
>
> I’m a constituent in [City/County]. I’m writing to ask you to oppose SB 178 / HB 970 as written.
>
> These bills create a new “preventive dental assistant” certification that can perform limited scaling/polishing (“above-the-gumline” cleanings). I’m concerned this can normalize partial cleanings, confuse patients about what care they received, and delay detection/treatment of periodontal disease.
>
> If the legislature moves forward, please add strict guardrails: clear eligibility criteria, independent competency verification, explicit patient disclosure/informed consent, mandatory outcome reporting, and a sunset clause with independent evaluation.
>
> Thank you for your time,
> [Name]
> [Address or ZIP]

## 2) Keep it fact-based
When you share, include sources. This improves credibility and reduces the chance of being dismissed as partisan.
