## Notes
- Legislative text and official bill status should be cited from the official Virginia Legislative Information System (LIS). The LIS site uses a JavaScript application, so direct text linking may vary.

If you’d like, we can add an **"Official bill links"** section once we confirm the best stable LIS URLs for SB 178 and HB 970.
