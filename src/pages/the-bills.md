# The Bills: SB 178 and HB 970

These bills are commonly described as **workforce expansion route B**. They would create/expand a **"preventive/preventative dental assistant"** role and authorize that role to perform **limited preventive cleanings** (often described publicly as **above-the-gumline scaling/polishing**) under dentist supervision.

## What supporters say
Supporters (including the Virginia Dental Association, as reported publicly) say the goal is to:
- reduce long waits for routine care;
- increase practice capacity;
- let dental hygienists focus on below-the-gumline care while assistants handle limited above-the-gumline tasks.

## What opponents are concerned about
Opponents argue this approach risks:
- **incomplete care** and delayed identification/treatment of periodontal disease;
- **patient confusion** (a “cleaning” that is not a full cleaning);
- insufficient or inconsistent training/competency verification;
- “productivity pressure” that can undermine safeguards in real-world settings.

## Key questions legislators should answer (before expanding scope)
If lawmakers advance these bills, they should answer—clearly and in statute/regulation—at minimum:

1) **Patient eligibility:** Which patients qualify for “above-the-gumline” scaling/polishing? How is periodontal status determined?

2) **Supervision definition:** Is this **direct** or **indirect** supervision? Is a dentist required to examine the patient the same day?

3) **Independent competency:** Is competency verified by an **independent clinical exam**, or primarily by employer attestation?

4) **Disclosure & consent:** Will patients be told—explicitly—when care is provided by a preventive dental assistant rather than a hygienist?

5) **Outcome reporting:** What adverse-event reporting, audits, or quality measurement will exist?

6) **Sunset & evaluation:** Will Virginia require a time-limited pilot (sunset clause) and independent evaluation before permanent statewide expansion?

## Recommended guardrails (if the bills move)
If the bills are not stopped, basic guardrails should include:
- clear eligibility criteria (exclude high-risk patients);
- explicit informed consent and patient-facing disclosure;
- independent competency testing and standardized curriculum;
- strong supervision requirements;
- mandatory reporting and Board oversight;
- a sunset clause.
