# Better solutions (without lowering standards)

## 1) Fix retention first
Multiple public reports frame Virginia’s problem as not simply “number of licensed hygienists,” but **retention** and working conditions.

Solutions can include:
- improving workplace culture and staffing models;
- benefits and scheduling flexibility;
- clear pathways for advancement and leadership.

## 2) Transparency and patient education
If workforce roles evolve, require:
- clear patient-facing explanation of the provider role;
- explicit consent;
- accurate documentation of the scope of what was done.

## 3) Targeted pilots with independent evaluation
If Virginia wants to test new models:
- use a **time-limited pilot**;
- require **independent outcome tracking** (safety events, re-appointment rates, periodontal outcomes, patient understanding);
- publish results before statewide expansion.

## 4) Expand access where it is actually limited
If rural access is the goal, pair workforce policies with:
- incentives for rural practice;
- support for public health clinics;
- transportation/appointment support;
- workforce pipeline programs tied to underserved placement.

## 5) If SB 178 / HB 970 advance, add guardrails
At minimum:
- clear eligibility criteria;
- independent competency verification;
- robust supervision definitions;
- reporting, audits, and a sunset clause.
