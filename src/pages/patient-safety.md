# Patient safety & standard of care

## Why "above-the-gumline only" is not a safe default
Scaling and polishing are not cosmetic add-ons. They are clinical procedures performed to **prevent and control disease**.

A “cleaning” that addresses only what’s visible above the gums can:
- create a **false sense of completion** for patients;
- delay identification of gingival/periodontal disease;
- allow inflammation to progress if subgingival areas are not addressed when indicated.

Public reporting on the Virginia debate quotes concerns that incomplete cleanings can contribute to **dysbiosis** and progression of inflammation/gum disease. (See **Sources**.)

## Patient transparency matters
If a new assistant role is expanded, patients must be able to understand:
- **who** provided the clinical procedure;
- **what** was and wasn’t done;
- **what follow-up** is recommended.

If people believe they received a full preventive cleaning when they did not, that is not informed consent.

## Real-world supervision is variable
Even if a procedure is permitted “under supervision,” the **quality of supervision varies** across settings.
Legislation should not assume perfect conditions—especially when its stated purpose is increased throughput.

## Bottom line
Virginia can improve access without weakening standards or confusing patients.
We should not normalize partial cleanings as a routine replacement for comprehensive preventive dental care.
